<h2> The first African superhero, Black Panther  was  released in 1966,<br> amid
  extremely tense racial relations  in the United States.<br> In an interview
  about creating the character, Stan Lee <br> said “A good many of our people
  here in  America are not white. <br> You’ve got to recognize that you’ve got to
  include them in <br> whatever you do” (2018). Black Panther struck a chord
  throughout <br> the African American community, from adults to children. There was
  <br>finally a superhero who took the place of Thor or Spiderman in the <br> toy boxes of
  African American children. The massive success of the Black <br>Panther series on
  and off screen stresses the importance <br> of representation to the silenced other,
  creating a hero that the <br> African American community  could finally, truly,
  identify with.</h2>
