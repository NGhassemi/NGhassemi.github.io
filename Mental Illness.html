Superheros all come with a backstory to explain  how they got their powers.
This backstory can also explain how mental illnesses developed in  the heroes
 we know and love. Mental illness has been prevalent in the Marvel Comics
 Universe  nearly since its inception. Captain America,  among the earliest of
  Marvel’s heroes, sought psychological counseling for PTSD  in the comics from
  the 1960’s and ‘70’s.  There are many other characters in the comic universe
   that prominently display mental illness. There are heroes with schizophrenia,
   depression and anxiety. Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and other Marvel authors have
   never ignored these struggles. Yet they do not make the mistake common in
   popular culture which tends to over exaggerate mental illness. Books,
   TV  shows and movies with characters who  suffer from a form of Mental
    illness  generally tend to fall into harmful tropes and stereotypes.
