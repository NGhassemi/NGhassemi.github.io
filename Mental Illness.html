<h2>

Superheros all come with a  backstory to explain  how they got their <br> powers.
This backstory can also explain how mental illnesses <br> developed in  the heroes
 we know and love. Mental illness has been prevalent in <br> the Marvel Comics
 Universe  nearly since its inception. Captain America, <br>  among the earliest of
  Marvel’s heroes, sought psychological counseling for PTSD <br> in the comics from
  the 1960’s and ‘70’s.  There are many other characters in the <br>comic universe
   that prominently display mental illness. There are heroes with <br>schizophrenia,
   depression and anxiety. Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and other Marvel <br> authors have
   never ignored these struggles. Yet they do not make the mistake <br> common in
   popular culture which tends to over exaggerate mental illness. <br> Books,
   TV  shows and movies with characters who  suffer from a form of <br> Mental
    illness  generally tend to fall into harmful  tropes and stereotypes.
