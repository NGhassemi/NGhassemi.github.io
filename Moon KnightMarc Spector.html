<h2> Marc Spector, aka Moon Knight, is often described as Batman with Dissociative
  Identity <br> Disorder. His comics not only involve the hero battling supervillains,
 but also his own <br> psyche. Unlike most superheroes, even others with mental disorders,
  Marc Spector does <br>not have one single origin story. There are various stories
   of Spector either being granted <br> his powers from an Egyptian God or, believing
   he had super powers to the point of <br> actually developing them through his fictive
   personality based on Captain America, <br>Wolverine, Spiderman, etc. Some of these
    stories include childhood trauma, others do <br> not. This provides a sense of
    realism to the character, depicting DID as a defense <br>mechanism rather
    than portraying it as an illness. </h2>
