<h2  style ="text-indent:.5cm;"><span>The Marvel Comic and Cinematic Universe spans across space, <br> time and reality.
    One would think that the concept of race would <br> not be a point of contention
    in its fictional universe as it is in <br> reality. Sadly, heroes of different
    race and gender have been met <br> with backlash solely for being a different
    gender or non-white, <br> especially when released in theatres.
    In spite of the hate however,  Black <br>Panther’s (2018)
    massive success paved the way for Marvel <br> Studios to release more of its
    diverse heroes: Shang-Chi (2022), <br>and Marvel’s Disney+ show  Ms. Marvel (2022).
    Marvel <br> pioneered with the Black Panther,  once more in a time of intense
    <br>racial unrest, and  once again, Marvel shows just how important it
    is to shatter <br> stereotypes and represent the silenced. </span></h2>
