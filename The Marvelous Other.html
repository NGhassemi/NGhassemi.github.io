<h1>The Marvelous Other </h1>


  <h2> The superhero genre is generally ridiculed. Everyone from big name
  film directors, to literary <br>critics and intellectual filmgoers turn up
  their noses at the thought of a superhero film or comic book.<br> Most recently,
  a renowned film director stated that the superhero genre
  (namely the Marvel Universe) <br>was merely  a “theme park”, something you
  go to solely for amusement. While these comics and movies <br>are indeed
  entertaining, they are so much more. It is because of their entertainment
  value that audiences <br>are more ready to accept their interwoven messages.
  For instance, during the racial unrest of the ‘60’s, <br> Stan Lee and Jack
  Kirby created Black Panther, the first African superhero. The Black
  Panther series<br> was hugely important as a “powerful source of racial
  meaning, narrative, and narrative in American <br>society that expresses a
  myriad of racial assumptions, political perspectives and  (re)imaginings
  of black <br>identity”  (Nama 4). The ability to create a narrative that spoke
  against stereotyping  the other is also <br> important for those suffering from
  a disability or mental illness. Marvel has  been  inclusive almost<br> since its
  inception. Daredevil, the blind crime fighting lawyer from New York for
  example, was <br> introduced in 1964, only 25 years after the studio was created.
  What this exhibit  hopes to accomplish is <br> to display that the superhero
  genre is not only meant to be a theme park filled with various<br> roller coasters
  for amusement. It examines the importance of creating the “superhero like me”.</h2>
