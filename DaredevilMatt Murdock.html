<h1> Daredevil/Matt Murdock </h1>
</body>
</html>

<h2> Daredevil, aka, Matt Murdock was blinded as a <br> boy when he pushed a blind man
 out of the way <br> of a truck carrying radioactive waste. Daredevil <br> was created
 in a time when disabeled people were <br> seen as a medical case first and a human
 being <br> second. Though he is an Avenger, Matt does not <br> actually have any bonafide
   super powers, <br> although his enhanced hearing allows him to <br> function without sight.
 What is often quoted <br> as his superpower   is his heart, his human-ness. <br>Matt’s
humanity is in stark contrast to how <br>disabled people were typically viewed by
 the<br> public and the medical community, as mere  <br>statistics or abnormal humans. </h2>
