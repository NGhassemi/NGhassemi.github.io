<h1> Ms. Marvel/Kamala Khan </h1>
</body>
</html>

<h2> Kamala Khan did for the American Muslim <br> community what Black Panther did for
  the <br> African American. In 2013, Kamala Khan, <br> aka Ms. Marvel made her first
  appearance <br> and was vastly popular. At the time there were <br>still extreme racial
 prejudices against Muslims <br> and people from the Middle East, with the phrase <br>
   “go back home” frequently shouted at individuals <br> who were actually born and
   raised in the U.S. <br> Although Kamala does not wear a Muslim Hijab, <br>she does
  shatter Western  stereotypes of Muslim <br> women.  In fact, she perpetuates the
   fact that though <br> she grew up in a Muslim household and her family <br> is from
   Pakistan, America is her home.</h2>
