  Kamala Khan did for the American Muslim
  community what <br> Black Panther did  for the
  African American. In 2013, Kamala Khan,
  <br> aka Ms. Marvel made her first appearance
  and was vastly popular. <br> At the time there were
  still extreme racial  prejudices against Muslims
  and <br> people from the Middle East, with the phrase
  “go back home” frequently <br> shouted at individuals
  who were actually born and raised in the U.S.
   <br> Although Kamala does not wear a Muslim Hijab,
  she does shatter Western <br> stereotypes of Muslim
  women. In fact, she perpetuates the fact that though
  she grew <br> up in a Muslim household and her family
  is from Pakistan, <br> America is her home.
