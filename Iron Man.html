<h2> “Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,” said Tony Stark in response
  to a verbal snipe <br>about his character from Steve Rogers in 2012’s “Avengers”.
   With descriptive attributes <br> such as those, what could possibly ail the great
   Tony Stark? While Robert Downey Jr.’s <br> outward portrayal of Tony Stark is iconic
   – he literally launched the MCU – there was more <br> Marvel got right about the
    character on the big screen then it let on. While not battling great foes, <br>
    Tony battles his inner demons, seen mostly in 2013’s “Iron Man 3” in forms
    of anxiety attacks. <br> While these are another form of bringing PTSD to light
    on the big screen – noting that it can <br> literally affect anyone –  Iron Man’s
    comic book counterpart suffered from alcoholism and <br> depression, similarly
    mirroring Downey’s own struggle with drugs. By having one of their most <br> beloved
    heroes suffer from addiction of this kind injects the idea into readers –
    especially of the <br> younger generations – that literally anybody can suffer from
    addiction. But, Tony’s admitting to <br> his addiction, and getting help for it also
    shows that recovery is possible, no matter how deep <br>into it a person is.
