<h1> Echo/Maya Lopez </h1>

</html>

<h2> Maya Lopez, aka, Echo is the intersection of disability <br>and minority in the
 Marvel Universe as she embodies <br> three underrepresented communities: that of the deaf,<br>
 of Native Americans and women as heroes. Lopez, <br>descended from the Cheyenne Nation,
  witnesses the <br> death of her parents at an extremely young age and <br> is taken in
  by the man who murdered them. Bilingual,<br>  she uses both American Sign Language
 and the Native <br> American Sign Language System to communicate. Her <br> character is
 vastly important for those of both <br> communities as they are often used as cliche <br>
   plot devices: to be killed off to advance the story <br> line. Because of Echo’s success.
   there has been a <br> rise of deaf superheroes and deaf representation <br> over the last two decades. </h2>
