<h1>Captain America/Steve Rogers </h1>
</body>
</html>

<h2> Injected with super soldier serum, Captain America is one <br> of the most
formidable MCU heroes. However, because he <br> was a hero bred for war, he cannot
live in a peaceful world. <br> Beneath the mask and in spite of the serum, Captain
<br> America is still Steve Rogers — ex-veteran with PTSD.<br> In the second Avengers
 movie, the Age of Ultron, it is <br> shown that his greatest fear is the inability
   to escape <br> war and the inability to live in a world without war. <br> While the
  media has constantly been harmful to the <br> portrayal of mental illness,
  more superheroes like <br> Captain America who suffer from mental illness but
  <br> acknowledge it and work with it, could be crucial in <br> changing public
  opinion and the attitudes of those with <br> mental illness.</h2>
