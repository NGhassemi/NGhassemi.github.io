  <h1> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pDnAgub6Hc"> Wade Wilson/Deadpool </a> </h1>
<p> warning, video content slightly graphic. </p>

  <h2> From Dissociative Identity Disorder, to Schizophrenia, Marvel has long been inclusive of <br> mental disorders.
     “The [schizophrenic] lives in the midst of affects that are not canalized <br> and regulated by social codifications …
     Furthermore,  the schizophrenic’s perception would <br> be differential and thus fragmented” (der Wielen).
     Among the most famous and well-loved <br> hero’s, Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, is famous for his goofy  nature and
     being self-aware. <br> Even without that academic definition of schizophrenia, Deadpool is canonically schizophrenic, <br>
     having developed it due to his extreme healing abilities. Deadpool  also displays character tendencies <br> that are
     well out of being regulated and  canalized by society. For instance, he has no remorse in killing <br> his enemies,
      where most of the other Avengers will <em> not </em> kill. Deadpool also stands a unique intersection <br> between disability and mental
     disorder. Wade Wilson, the man underneath the Deadpool mask was ironically, <br> horribly, and permanently disfigured
     when he acquired his healing powers in an effort to cure his terminal cancer.
