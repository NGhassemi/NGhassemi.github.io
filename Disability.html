<h1> Disability </h1>

<h2> Disability in the media is often misrepresented and <br> overexaggerated.
  The  blind and deaf are often  portrayed as <br> having their other senses  immensely enhanced
   because one is <br> missing. However, this  is not the  case. Marvel’s Daredevil series <br> and the
  character of Maya Lopez, aka Echo,  portray disability <br> more accurately. Daredevil’s senses are
   only enhanced because of <br> radioactive waste, and Echo’s, through her training. These <br> superheroes
     helped derail “media depictions which deployed <br> sentimentality and a ‘pity model’ … for the unfortunate” <br>
     (Alaniz 71). I  would be remiss  however not to mention the <br> Hollywood scandal regarding  the character
    of Hawkeye. Deaf in <br> the comics, his cinematic counterpart most definitely was not. <br> This step backwards
    in  representation of disabeled characters to <br> promote the idea that only able bodied white people could be
    <br> superheros was met with immense backlash. It was a stark <br> reminder of the silencing that
    minority and disabled communities <br> are forced to face. </h2>
